G91 ; relative positioning
G1 S2 Z4 F200 ; lower bed 4mm to ensure it is above the Z probe trigger height
G1 H1 X155 F1200 ; move quickly to X axis endstop and stop there (first pass)
G1 X-5 F6000 ; go back a few mm
G1 H1 X155 F360 ; move slowly to X axis endstop once more (second pass)
G1 H1 Y155 F1200 ; move quickly to Y axis endstop and stop there (first pass)
G1 Y-5 F6000 ; go back a few mm
G1 H1 Y155 F360 ; move slowly to Y axis endstop once more (second pass)
G1 Y-22.5 F360 ; move slowly to Y axis endstop once more (second pass)
G1 X-2 F360 ; move slowly to Y axis endstop once more (second pass)
G90 ; absolute positioning
G1 X75 Y75 F2000 ; put head over the centre of the bed
